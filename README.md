# University-Progression-Predictor

This is a Python console application developed for a module coursework. The program is designed to predict a student's academic progression outcome (e.g., Progress, Module Retriever, Exclude) at the end of an academic year based on their volume of credits achieved at Pass, Defer, and Fail levels.

Key Features:
Progression Outcome Calculation: Determines the outcome based on University regulations (Pass, Defer, Fail credits).
Input Validation: Validates input for correct data type, credit range (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120), and total credits adding up to 120.
Multiple Outcome Processing: Loops to allow staff to process progression data for multiple students.
Data Visualization: Generates a basic text-based histogram summarizing the number of outcomes in each progression category.
Extension: Implements data storage using lists, text files, and/or dictionaries for persistent recording and display of progression data (extension parts).
